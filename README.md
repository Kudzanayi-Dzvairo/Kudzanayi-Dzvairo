# Hi, I'm Kudzanayi 👋🏾

I'm a self-taught software engineer interested in creating technology that elevates and connects people. I'm a big fan of vanilla JS but I also enjoy working in ReactJS. I am constantly building things to get better and when I'm not doing that I enjoy challenging myself with algorithms. 

I like JS strings but I love guitar strings 🎸
