I'm a self-taught software engineer who interested in creating technology to elevate people, and build communities. Big fan of vanilla JS but I also enjoy working in ReactJS. When I'm not creating through projects I enjoy challenging myself with algorithms. And when I'm not on a computer I'm probably strumming my guitar 🎸
